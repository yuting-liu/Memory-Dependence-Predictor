# Memory-Dependence-Predictor on Gem 5
===
Team Member: Yuting Liu, and Danni Wang

## Specification

Since Gem5 platform file is really too large to fit in github, I only extract the memory repository where we implement different technologies of memory dependence predictor.

To know more about the Gem5, please check [HERE](http://gem5.org/Main_Page)

After downloading GEM5 system, please rename `mem_load_pair/` and `mem_store_set/` into `mem/`, to substitute `src/mem/`.

## Performance
We use with [SPEC CPU 2006](https://www.spec.org/cpu2006/) to judge the performance of our implementations.

## Implementations

### Naive

### Non-Speculation

### Store Load Pair


### Store Sets

## Report
To know more about our project, please see the [report]() here with more specific implementation details and our performance analysis.
